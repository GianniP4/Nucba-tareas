    <p>
        New blood joins this Earth
        And quickly he's subdued
        Through constant pained disgrace
        The young boy learns their rules
    </p>

    <p>
        With time, the child draws in
        This whipping boy done wrong
        Deprived of all his thoughts
        The young man struggles on and on, he's known
    </p>

    <p>
        Ooh, a vow unto his own
        That never from this day
        His will they'll take away, yeah
    </p>

    <p>
        What I've felt, what I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never be, never see
        Won't see what might have been
    </p>

    <p>
        What I've felt, what I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never free, never me
        So I dub thee Unforgiven
    </p>

    <p>
        They dedicate their lives
        To running all of his
        He tries to please them all
        This bitter man he is
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Throughout his life the same
        He's battled constantly
        This fight he cannot win
        A tired man they see no longer care
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The old man then prepares
        To die regretfully
        That old man here is me, yeah        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What I've felt, what I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never be, never see
        Won't see what might have been
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What I've felt, what I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never free, never me
        So I dub thee Unforgiven
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What I've felt, what I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never be, never see
        Won't see what might have been
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What I've felt, what I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never free, never me
        So I dub thee Unforgiven, oh, oh
        
        Never free, never me
        So I dub thee Unforgiven
        You labeled me, I'll label you
        So I dub thee Unforgiven
        
        Never free, never me
        So I dub thee Unforgiven
        You labeled me, I'll label you
        So I dub thee Unforgiven
        
        Never free, never me
        So I dub thee Unforgiven
